## Java 17
A new long-term support (LTS) release of standard Java, is now available for production use. 
Oracle also announced that LTS releases, which receive at least eight years of product support, henceforth will arrive every two years, as opposed to the three years between releases in the past. Non-LTS releases get six months of support from Oracle.
